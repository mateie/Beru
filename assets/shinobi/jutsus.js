            description: 'To perform, the user first gathers lightning to their hand; the high concentration of electricity produces a sound reminiscent of many birds chirping, hence the name. The lightning chakra has been shown on occasions to damage the user\'s hand, peeling the skin and causing it to smoulder slightly, but this does not appear to actually be debilitating. Once the chakra is gathered, users charge at their target and thrust the Chidori into them, piercing them and typically causing fatal damage. Despite the sound it makes, the rapid speed at which it\'s used makes it useful for assassinations.',

To do this, the user surgically injects a certain amount of their own chakra into the opponent\'s chakra pathway system, causing damage to surrounding organs due to their proximity to the chakra circulatory system.
